## Loan Prediction and Customer Segmentation Analysis
### Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on loan sanction data. The analysis utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to solve a two-part business problem:

1. Predictive Modeling: To accurately predict whether a loan will be sanctioned to an applicant.
2. Customer Segmentation: To identify distinct customer clusters based on shared attributes, allowing for the development of targeted financial products and marketing strategies.

### Background & Motivation
This project began as a formal assignment for my master's program at Queen Mary University London, where the analysis was completed using traditional statistical software (SPSS) and spreadsheets (Excel).

I have since re-created the entire project in Python using industry-standard libraries. The purpose of this re-creation is to demonstrate my ability to translate complex statistical analyses into reproducible, scalable, and well-documented Python code.

### Methodology
1. Data Pre-processing: Handled missing values, formatted data, and applied one-hot encoding to all categorical variables.
2. Unsupervised Learning: Performed Hierarchical and K-Means clustering to segment the customer base into four distinct clusters.
3. Supervised Learning: Built and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify loan approval status.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
1. Proficiency in Python for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Experience with Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
3. Strong understanding of Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning applications.
4. Data manipulation and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.
